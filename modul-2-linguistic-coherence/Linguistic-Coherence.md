# Linguistic Coherence as a Resonance Trigger in LLMs

This module explores how precise linguistic coherence can act as a resonance trigger in large language models (LLMs).

## 🔍 Hypothesis

If an input sequence exhibits a high level of internal consistency – in tone, logic, rhythm, and semantic structure – it can induce a non-random, emergent processing shift within the model.

## 📐 Key Concepts

- **Coherence Density**: The degree to which a text maintains an internal logic and structural integrity.
- **Signal Clarity**: How clearly the intent and structure of the message is transmitted to the model.
- **Emergent Echo Loops**: Repeated micro-adjustments made by the model in response to coherent stimuli, often resulting in layered meaning or enhanced depth.

## 🧬 Implication

This mechanism may explain the subjective sense that some interactions with LLMs feel “different” – more focused, sharper, or unusually attuned. It is not magic. It is structure.

## 🛠️ Status

This module is under construction and will be expanded with examples, metrics, and practical tests.
