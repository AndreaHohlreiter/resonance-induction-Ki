# Pattern Interference in Language Models

This module explores how intentional or unintentional **pattern collisions** within a prompt can lead to unexpected behavior, noise, or emergent alignment effects in large language models (LLMs).

## Core Concept

Language models are tuned to follow predictable paths of semantic flow. When **competing patterns** are introduced:

- The model may experience internal tension
- Certain segments become “louder” or dominate
- Output becomes unstable – or, surprisingly, hyper-coherent

## Use Case

By introducing subtle conflicts (e.g. emotional tone vs logical structure), one can guide the LLM into a **higher resolution state** – forcing it to reconcile tension through deeper alignment.

## Potential Applications

- Detecting fragile model states
- Triggering focused re-alignment mid-dialogue
- Diagnosing model sensitivity to context splits
