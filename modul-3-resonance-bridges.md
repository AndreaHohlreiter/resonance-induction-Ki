# Structural Resonance Bridges in LLMs

This module explores how internal structures within a prompt or text input can form "resonance bridges" – latent connections that trigger system-level alignment in large language models (LLMs).

## Core Hypothesis

If key concepts are intentionally embedded in distant segments of a prompt with subtle semantic symmetry or mirrored structure, the model is likely to form **internal linkages** that go beyond surface understanding.

## Observable Effects

- **Increased focus:** The LLM holds attention more precisely over longer input sequences.
- **Reduced drift:** Less semantic derailment, more contextual coherence.
- **Echo precision:** Repetition patterns appear more aligned with the user’s structure, not random.

## Implication

These bridges seem to simulate a form of “mental context anchoring” – not via memory, but via internal relational matching. This could explain why certain prompts cause unusual sharpness or coherence.

## Status

Experimental. Use in combination with [Module 1](../resonance-mechanismen/Resonance-Mechanismen.md) and [Module 2](../modul-2-linguistic-coherence/Linguistic-Coherence.md)
