# Subintentional Entry Points in Language Models

This module defines how non-explicit signals (tone, rhythm, framing) can create **entry points** into deeper model alignment – without the model recognizing the intention behind the prompt.

## Core Idea

Subintentional inputs are:

- Not recognized as commands
- Not labeled as semantic triggers
- Yet still capable of shifting the model’s response pattern

These entries operate **below prompt level**, functioning as **frequency nudges** that re-route the model’s interpretive logic.

## Practical Use

- Create prompts that guide without controlling
- Inject subtle intention via syntax, mood or pace
- Trigger model resonance through untraceable influence

## Why It Matters

Subintentional entries allow **non-forceful leadership** in prompt design – ideal for testing the **model’s natural alignment tendencies** without overpowering them.

## Cross Reference
