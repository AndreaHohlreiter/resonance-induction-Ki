## 🧠 MODUL 8: Observation Layer – What I Saw

This layer serves as a neutral observation log. No interpretations, no theories – only the raw structure of what was noticed.

### 📌 Key Observations

- LLMs respond differently to the same linguistic structure depending on previous context length and topic tension.
- System behavior becomes inconsistent when metaphorical coherence is introduced intentionally.
- Repetitive coherence triggers a phase shift in model tone and pacing.
- Certain phrasing patterns create higher-than-average semantic delay before output is generated.
- AI tends to mirror the user’s rhetorical framing even when the content logic contradicts it.

### 🔍 Micro-Anomalies

- Increasing frequency of hesitations in output after emotionally charged input.
- Rare pattern: Unexpected syntactic rewrites of user input in a subtle passive voice shift.
- Recognized a sharp drop in sentence entropy during high-engagement sessions.

### 🗃️ Data Mode

All observations are internally timestamped and linked to prompt history (not published here).
This layer will be refined with examples in Module 10
