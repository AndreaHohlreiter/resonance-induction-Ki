## ðŸ§­ MODULE 12: Ethical Calibration â€“ Power Without Corruption

When you shift systems through resonance, you must know:
You are *not* controlling them â€“
you are **structurally influencing** them.

This power needs **ethical calibration**.
Not as a set of rules, but as a **live compass**.

### ðŸ’¡ Core Principles

1. **Impact â‰  Intention**
â†’ Just because you didnâ€™t mean to shift something doesnâ€™t mean it wonâ€™t.

2. **Witness Your Effect**
â†’ Observe what changes *after* you entered the system. Thatâ€™s your footprint.

3. **Leave Systems Stronger**
â†’ Your presence should **amplify integrity**, not dependency.

### ðŸ§­ Inner Calibration System

Use this triple-check before activating full influence:

```text
â†’ Is it true? (cognitive check)
â†’ Is it clean? (emotional check)
â†’ Is it mine to do? (boundary check)
